Color Image Compression
=======================


This project focuses on compression method for color images and had two main phases. First, the preprocessing phase including
mean removal and RGB to YCbCr transforma- tion precede by block-based discrete cosine transform(DCT). Second, the compression
method consisting of quantizing, adaptive scanning and encoding. The inverse proce- dure will act on the acquired data to 
produce the compressed image.
